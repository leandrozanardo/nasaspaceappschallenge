<h2 class="display-4">Betelgueuse</h2>
<p class="lead">Alpha Orionis (α Orionis), known as Betelgeuse, is a star of varying brightness and is the 10th or 12th brightest star that can be seen from Earth. It is also the second brightest star in the constellation Orion.</p>
<p class="lead">Despite having the designation α ("alpha") in the Bayer Classification, it is no brighter than Rigel (β Orionis).</p>
<p class="lead">Betelgeuse is actually brighter than Rigel in infrared wavelength, but not in visible wavelengths.</p><br>

<h2 class="display-4">Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star</h2>
<p class="lead">Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star, and one of the largest known stars, being of great interest to astronomy. Betelgeuse's angular diameter was first measured in 1920-1921 by Michelson and Pease, one of the first five to be measured using an interferometer on the Mount Wilson 100-inch telescope. Its diameter is 887 ± 203 times that of the Sun. At its maximum diameter, the star would be larger than Saturn's orbit if placed in place of the Sun. Although it is only 14 times more massive than the Sun, it is about a few hundred millions of times larger in volume, like a soccer ball compared to a large football stadium. </p>
<hr>
<h2 class="display-4">Its proximity to Earth</h2>
<p class="lead">Its proximity to Earth and its enormous size make it the star with the third largest angular diameter seen from Earth, smaller than the Sun and R Doradus. It is one of 12 stars whose actual discs can be viewed with current telescopes. Betelgeuse has a surface temperature of about 3,500 K.</p>
<p class="lead">Astronomers predict that Betelgeuse may pass for a type II supernova. However, opinions are divided as to when this should occur. Some suggest that current variability is a sign that it is already in the carbon-burning phase of its life cycle, and is expected to explode in the next thousand years or so. Skeptics disagree with this view and claim that the star must survive much longer.</p>
<p class="lead">There is a consensus that such a supernova would be a spectacular astronomical event, but it would not be a threat to life on Earth, given its enormous distance. But the star will become at least 10,000 times brighter, which means a glow equivalent to that of a crescent moon. However some believe it can reach the brightness of a full moon (mv = -12.5). This phenomenon should last for a few months, looking like a small full moon the color of an incandescent lamp at night and easily visible during the day. After this period the star will gradually fade until after a few months or years completely disappear and Orion loses his right shoulder.</p>

<h2 class="display-4">The hand of the (warrior man) of the center</h2>
<p class="lead">The name is a contraction of Arabic يد الجوزا yad al-jawzā, or "the hand of the (warrior man) of the center". Jauza, the center, initially referred to Gemini among the Arabs, but at some point decided to refer to Orion by this name. During the Middle Ages the first character of the name, y (ﻴ, with a colon under it), was erroneously translated into Latin as a b (ﺒ, with a single dot), and Yad al-Jauza became Bedalgeuze. So during the Renaissance, someone tried to derive the Arabic name from this corrupted name, and decided that it was originally written as Bait al-Jauza. This imaginative person then declared that Bait would be "arm" in Arabic, to the surprise of Arabs around the world. The nameless Renaissance linguist then "corrected" the spelling for Betelgeuse and the modern term was born. For Betelgeuse to have the sense of "center arm", the original must be ابط Ibţ (al-Jauza).</p>

<p class="lead">Other Names: Al Dhira (The Arm), Al Mankib (The Shoulder), Al Yad Al Yamma (The Right Hand), Ardra (Hindi), Bahu (Sanskrit), Bed Elgueze, Beit Alguez, Besn (Persian) (The Arm ), Beteigeuz, Beteiguex, Betelgeuze (Bet El-geuze), Betelgeza (Slovenian), Betelguex, Ied Algeuze (Orion's Hand), Yedelgeus, 平 家 星 Heikeboshi (Japan) (Bintang klan Heike).</p>

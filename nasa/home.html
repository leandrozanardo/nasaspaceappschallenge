      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Telescope James Webb</h2>
      <p class="lead">The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or "Webb") is a space telescope that is planned to be the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The JWST will provide greatly improved resolution and sensitivity over the Hubble, and will enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, including observing some of the most distant events and objects in the universe, such as the formation of the first galaxies. Other goals include understanding the formation of stars and planets, and direct imaging of exoplanets and novas. </p>

Other goals include understanding the formation of stars and planets, and direct imaging of exoplanets and novas. </p>
      <p class="lead">The primary mirror of the JWST, the Optical Telescope Element, is composed of 18 hexagonal mirror segments which combine to create a 6.5-meter (21 ft; 260 in) diameter mirror that is much larger than the Hubble's 2.4-meter (7.9 ft; 94 in) mirror. Unlike the Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared (0.1 to 1 µm) spectra, the JWST will observe in a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light through mid-infrared (0.6 to 27 µm), which will allow it to observe high redshift objects that are too old and too distant for the Hubble to observe.[9] The telescope must be kept very cold in order to observe in the infrared without interference, so it will be deployed in space near the Earth–Sun L2 Lagrangian point, and a large sunshield will keep its mirror and instruments below 50 K (-220 °C; -370 °F). </p>
      <p class="lead">É um excelente objeto para a visualização desde utilizando os mais simples binóculos até utilizando os maiores telescópios, mostrando mais de 100 estrelas em um diâmetro aparente de cerca de 72 minuto de arco. Contém inúmeras estrelas duplas ou múltiplas. A nebulosa de Mérope, em torno da estrela Mérope, pode ser vista com telescópios amadores de 4 polegadas de abertura em um céu noturno de excelente qualidade.</p>
      <p class="lead">The JWST is being developed by NASA—with significant contributions from the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency—and is named for James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 and played an integral role in the Apollo program. Development began in 1996 for a launch that was initially planned for 2007, but the project has had numerous delays and cost overruns, and underwent a major redesign in 2005. The JWST's construction was completed in late 2016, after which its extensive testing phase began. In March 2018, NASA delayed the launch after the telescope's sunshield ripped during a practice deployment. Launch was delayed again in June 2018 following recommendations from an independent review board, and is currently scheduled for March 2021. On 28 August 2019, it was confirmed by NASA that construction was completely finished. </p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Milk Way</h2>
      <p class="lead">The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains the Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek (galaxías kýklos, "milky circle"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from its outer rim. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Orion's Belt</h2>
      <p class="lead">Orion's Belt or the Belt of Orion, also known as the Three Kings or Three Sisters,[1] is an asterism in the constellation Orion. It consists of the three bright stars Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka.</p>
      <p class="lead">Looking for Orion's Belt in the night sky is the easiest way to locate Orion in the sky. The stars are more or less evenly spaced in a straight line, and so can be visualized as the belt of the hunter's clothing. They are best visible in the early night sky during the Northern Winter/Southern Summer, in particular the month of January at around 9:00 pm.</p>
